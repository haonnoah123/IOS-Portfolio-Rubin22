## AP CSA Projects
* [Advent of Code](https://github.com/haonnoah123/adventOfCode2021) During the month of December I tried to complete as many days of Advent of Code as possible. At the beginning the challenges were simply but very quickly started to get harder and challenge my skills. I learned a lot about how to approach coding problems, and expanded my problem solving skills. 

* [Other Projects](https://github.com/haonnoah123/AP-CSA-2021) While taking AP CSA I was assigned many projects and labs to test my skills and knoledge. Some of these projects include: Hawaiian Words, Hangman, and Crossword. 

## [Discord Survivor Bot](https://github.com/haonnoah123/discordSurvivorBot)
* After learning Java in AP CSA decided to test my skills by coding a Discord Bot that mimics the TV show survivor. I started with the bot having simple functions, such as giving players idols for correctly guessing a number between 1-100. However, I quickly scaled it up adding features like voting and the ability to play idols.

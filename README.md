# iOS-Portfolio-Rubin22

Hi! My name is Noah Rubin and this is my protfolio of projects I have worked on throughout high school. I have taken both AP CSA where I learned Java and I have also taken iOS app development where I learned how to use Swift, SwiftUI, and SpriteKit. I have worked on many projects using my skills from AP CSA such as Hawaiian Words, and coding a Discord Bot to replicate the game show Survivor. Currently I am working on the development of SkySkirmish, which is a Bullet-Hell style game, which is developed using SpriteKit.

## [Discord Survivor Bot](https://github.com/haonnoah123/discordSurvivorBot)
* After learning Java in AP CSA decided to test my skills by coding a Discord Bot that mimics the TV show survivor. I started with the bot having simple functions, such as giving players idols for correctly guessing a number between 1-100. However, I quickly scaled it up adding features like voting and the ability to play idols.

## [SkySkirmish](https://github.com/WillPeyer/SkySkirmish)
* SkySkirmish is a game under the bullet hell genre. I have worked on the flight paths, enemies, upgrades, and much more. The app has been co-developed with @WillPeyer, and has been a learning experience for both of us. It has been fun to see the progression of the game from simple player movement to automating flight paths and damage upgrades. We are coding it on xCode using spriteKit which was new for both Will and I.

## [Post-It App](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Spring2022GroupProject)
* Post-It is an App 

## [Advent of Code](https://github.com/haonnoah123/adventOfCode2021)
* During the month of December I tried to complete as many days of Advent of Code as possible. At the beginning the challenges were simply but very quickly started to get harder and challenge my skills. I learned a lot about how to approach coding problems, and expanded my problem solving skills. 

## [AP CSA Projects](https://github.com/haonnoah123/AP-CSA-2021) 
* While taking AP CSA I was assigned many projects and labs to test my skills and knoledge. Some of these projects include: Hawaiian Words, Hangman, and Crossword. 

## xCode Tutorials
* [War Card Game](https://github.com/haonnoah123/warCardGame)
  * The[ War Card Game tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIxq4TCdlRU) from CodeWithChris was my first ever project using xCode and Swift. I learned a lot about buttons, VStacks, HStacks, and how to set up SwiftUI views. It also shows how to add and use images in apps.
* [MapKit/SwiftUI Tutorial](https://github.com/haonnoah123/Apple-Map-Tutorial)
  * The [SwiftUI Tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui) from Apple was a very in depth tutorial which I used to advance my knowledge on both SwiftUI and Swift. I learned about how to setup navigation views, utilize JSON files, use Structures, and navigate user input.
